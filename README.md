# Scrapper And Find Matching

### for testing result
```
npm run test
```

### for scrap from datasource
```
npm run scrap-data
```

### Note

I have a problem when I scapped Sheet 1 (Scrapped listing)
library I choose `google-sheet` has a problem when it has empty header at first row
I not have enough time to fix it so I make a copy of sheet and remove empty header
and scrap form it instead
